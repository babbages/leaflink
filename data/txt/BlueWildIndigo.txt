History &
Fun Facts
All of the
plants we sell
are native to
the Ohio area.
That means
they are
adapted and
ready to be a
beautiful, worry
free, addition
to your yard!
The Blue Wild Indigo is also known as the
False Indigo and grows much faster than
the true Indigo. This name came about
when Europeans would pay for
Americans to grow the plant so that they
could use the deep blue flowers to make
a dye similar in color of the true Indigo.
Although this plant is a member of the
pea family, parts have been deemed toxic
and so it should not be eaten. The Wild
Indigo Duskywing butterfly takes
advantage of this chemical to protect their
eggs from predators.

PPGSA
The Plant Pathology Graduate Student
Association (PPGSA) is a non-profit
organization. Funding of the activities are
provided though volunteer-based activities, such
as charities. PPGSA is not an official part of the
Ohio State University, but will nonetheless
respect many of the bylaws laid forth by the
Council of Graduate Students (CGS) when
appropriate.
These fliers are brought to you by our Outreach
Committee. The main function of this committee
is to both create a greater student awareness
and understanding of plant pathology in order to
broaden the numbers of future plant pathologists
in our department and across the country as well
as to increase community awareness of the
general nature of plant pathology.

Common
Problems

Plant Requirements and Description
Blue Wild Indigo

It is important to know the common
problems different plants in your
garden may experience so that you
can better manage the issues and
ensure your plants are providing the
ascetics you desire.
Baptesia are relatively diseases resistant
but do occasionally get some foliar
diseases. Powdery mildew, and leaf spot,
both caused by fungi, are among the
common problems. Symptoms of powdery
mildew are a grey or white fluffy or
“powdery” appearance on the upper sides
of leaves (pictured below). Spider mites
may also occasionally occur.

Growth Rate:
Moderate

Description:
These plants establish by first growing an extensive
root system, which makes them drought tolerant.
Vertical growth begins to increase in subsequent years,
producing striking blue flowers from May to June.
This leguminous plant is a member of the bean
family (Fabaceae) and partners with rhizobial bacteria to
produce its own fertilizer from nitrogen in the air.

Keep plants well-spaced & weed free.
Spacing helps reduce humidity in the foliage
which prevent fugal growth.
Planting plants in a sunny location. In
addition, to photosynthetic health of your
flowers, this also helps dry out any moisture
and prevent fungal growth.
Water the plants from the bottom. Watering
plants from the bottom is a wise practice no
matter the plant. This prevents excess
moisture on the leaves which can lead to
fungal growth or scotching from the sun.
Remove any & all infected plant parts. Make
sure not to compost any infected plant parts
as the fungal spores can be spread by wind
or water.
For mites: gently shake the branches of the
bush to dislodge the insects or use a strong
spray of water.

These plants are perfect
additions to any garden.
